npm start - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
npm run build - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
npm run build:watch - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier in "watch mode"; when changes occur to source files, they will be recompiled or copied into dist/.
npm run lint - runs tslint on the project files.
npm run serve - runs lite-server.
